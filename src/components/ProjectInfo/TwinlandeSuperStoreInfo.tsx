                <p>
                    Twinlande Superstore (TSS) is a full stack web application. This is an application for a fictional store run by twin sisters Dlo & Dife.
                </p>
                <p>
                    TSS was created to learn how to build a full stack application from the ground up with the help of a community.
                    I wanted to have a deeper understanding of how to build the frontend, backend, and database of an application while learning how to create content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created this project to build my social skills, especially when it comes to technology! I realized that when it comes to talking about tech, I freeze up and stutter!
                    Iâ€™m hoping with this project, I can grow my confidence.
